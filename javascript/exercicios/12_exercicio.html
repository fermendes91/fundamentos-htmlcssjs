        <p>You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.</p>

        <p>Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.</p>

        <p>You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who
            tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face.
            And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to
            know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't stand the sight
            of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.</p>
    
        <p>Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?</p>
    
        <p>It was a dog. It was a big dog.</p>
    
        <p>A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.</p>
    
        <p>Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.</p>
    
        <p>I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I
            can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.</p>
    
        <p>I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.</p>
    
        <p>You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be
            casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.</p>
    
        <p>You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off
            crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me
            watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?".
            He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that
            face." and... Why so serious?</p>
    
        <p>You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.</p>
    
        <p>I got another another job. Your.</p>
    
        <p>Bruce... it's okay. Don't be afraid.</p>
